# 🌿 Sugarcane Node Detection using YOLOv8

This project aims to detect **nodes on sugarcane stalks** using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. The system is capable of detecting nodes in both images and videos, and it can be extended to real-time detection for agricultural automation.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Model Used:** YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once - Ultralytics)
- **Objective:** Detect nodes on sugarcane using object detection
- **Frameworks:** Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Training Data:** Custom-annotated dataset (in YOLO format)
- **Output:** Bounding boxes over sugarcane nodes in images or videos

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. ✅ Install Requirements

Install Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

Alternatively, clone and set up Ultralytics from their official repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
cd ultralytics
pip install -e .
```

---

### 2. 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model

To train the model on your custom sugarcane dataset:

```bash
python train.py
```

Make sure the dataset follows the YOLO format:

```
/dataset
 ├── images/
 │    ├── train/
 │    └── val/
 └── labels/
      ├── train/
      └── val/
```

Update dataset path and configuration inside `train.py`.

### 3. 🔍 Running Detection

Use the `detect.py` script for inference on images, videos, or webcam:

#### a. On an image:

```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/image.jpg --weights best.pt
```

#### b. On a video:

```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/video.mp4 --weights best.pt
```

#### c. On live webcam:

```bash
python detect.py --source 0 --weights best.pt
```

Detected nodes will be shown with bounding boxes and saved to the `runs/detect` folder by default.
